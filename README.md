# dbt_playground

I wanted to explore dbt, and here are the steps I have taken so far. 
1. ran docker image locally to spin up a MySQL container
2. built db connection in TablePlus, similar to Dbeaver, a tool to visualize the data and do query on
3. grab data from Kaggle open dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce this dataset contains 9 e-commerce data csv which was organized using Kimball methodology: such as order_info, customer_info,payment_info, review_info. etc
